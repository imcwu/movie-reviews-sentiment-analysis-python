## ðŸ’¡ Interpretation of the Results - Patterns, Insights
Overall, it is harder to determine if a comment is negative because there are so many ambiguous words that can be used to express a reviewer's dissatisfaction with a film, because they can mention specific scenes or details about the movie that they didn't like, while for positive reviews, usually they mention the same adjectives like "amazing", "fantastic", or "great" to describe the film overall. Additionally, filtering the text in the beginning to remove all capitalization and special symbols help prevent discrepancies and misses from occurring during the process.
